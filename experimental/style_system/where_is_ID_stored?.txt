where is ID attached?


attaching ID directly to the style allows for getting the ID when you have the Style
ie, I want to add THIS STYLE to a Cascade

cascades always reference Styles by ID, but the tricky part is getting the IDs into the Cascade


but then how does that align with trying to get multiple IDs to overlap so you can pallet swap?
	+ should any pallet of n elements be switchable with any other n-element pallet?
		that would allow for many happy accidents
	+ create one pallet, duplicate pallet, and then swap out the styles on the new pallet
		makes sense for a workflow to allow multiple pallets to switch in-and-out
		seems to remove the chance for "accidental" pallet swaps






you CAN NOT assign IDs directly on the Styles
because then the mapping would be one-to-one

that means you can't have multiple IDs which map to the same Style

that would completely prevent pallet swapping



THAT IS IN THE GENERAL SENSE
(ie, "global" scope: across multiple pallets, cascades, and styles)



but local to one Pallet,
then the ID is one-to-one with the Style
so you could store the data in a bi-directional hash and it would be fine







now, are the IDs assigned by the Pallet, or some external thing?











if you attach the id to the style directly
the same style can be referenced with the same id across multiple pallets

what you really want is
being able to reference multiple styles with the same ID
the disambiguation comes from using different pallets
that is the nature of pallet swapping
