when you serialize a Style component, link to actual style objects using their unique IDs

not sure how to generate these IDs though
should they be user generated?
	then the "name" of the style could just be it's ID as well
	
	would be similar to Blender though, where you can never have two items with the exact same name
	even if the object hierarchy makes it clear that these are different things.
	you end up having to do namespacing-by-prefix,
	even though the hierarchy should give you a sort of "namespacing"
	which is all sorts of dumb


should they be unique computer-assigned ID number?
	can't use the object ID, because that's managed by Ruby,
	and can't be guaranteed consistent across multiple sessions
	
	(don't want the save data to change just because IDs are being shuffled)
