style object name properties



names attached to underlying data, not user visible objects
	for reference, Blender has both underlying data names and larger object names
	but this is because they seek to organize data in a linear visual hierarchy,
	a list of names
	
	the entire purpose of THoughtTrace is to allow organization through spatial relations,
	so organization within a hierarchy list is both unnecessary and undesirable

names can be changed at will
	changing names should not affect any other piece of data

that implies that
names are not necessarily unique
	much like the names of people
	names are "common identifiers"
	rather than rigorous and guaranteed unique ones

persist across sessions


exist to aid end user organization of data
through symbolic shorthand for a piece of data (the shorthand likely possesses semantic value)
	* does this mean they're kinda like tags? or is there something else
	by which I mean the ThoughtSpace tags (proposed future feature)
	which label Entities so that they can be referenced by name
	
	this is not quite the same as "tags" in the general data organization sense
	as seen on Delicious bookmarks, or photo management systems
