style object id properties

can't change unique object id
ids persist across sessions
deleting one id does not affect other ids
creating a new id does not affect other ids

ids with a certain StyleSpace should be unique
(it's nice if IDs are unique across many documents, but not necessary)





need to be able to create multiple pallets with the same IDs
this is what allows for pallet swapping

this notion is at odds with the idea that IDs are unique within a StyleSpace
as multiple pallets can exist within on StyleSpace

	should many pallets with the same set of IDs be created by creating "shallow copies"(ish)
	of one reference pallet?
	
	like, say I create a pallet with 5 styles in it, and then I want to have pallet swapping
	so I "clone" that pallet (shallow) and then change all the style properties



alternatively, think of the problem this way:
do you want all pallets to assign keys in the same order?
this would mean that any pallet of 5 styles could be applied in any case requiring 5 styles or less
	that kinda gives the id => object mapping value
	and you would want to be able to control which objects are in which id "slots"
	
	
	this allows for a lot of "happy accidents" though, which could spur creativity
	this sort of thing is why I desire to paint in b/w and then map colors via color ramp
	because then you could easily swap out colors
	or even glitch out the maps for cool effects
