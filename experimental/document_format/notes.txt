=== Serialzation of entities / components
+ serialize entities separately from their components
+ link them back up again on load

this structure allows for maintaining the current serialization build system
(which is actually really useful)
(in terms of application, but also, the process of development helped build understanding of data)
======================================================





=== Data formats
Best to use different formats to suit different types of data 





YAML may be the best bet for serialization of components
(the physics component continues to be a weird special case, just like in Unity...)

+ tree-ish structure
+ links to repeated data

it has no problem with compressing the convoluted dependency structure of the style system
	--
	any attempt to generate a custom format would have to solve the problem
	It's not just a straight-line of components -> cascades -> style objects
	largely because the cascades have the same access interface as the style objects
	and thus can be used in the same context
	(nested cascades are a thing, and are very useful and necessary)
	(in particular, the query system uses this structure for style data)
	--



However, CSV is much better for the entities themselves        (the physics data is included here)
as CSV is just a list of lists,
and each entity data blob is just a list,
where most entries are either numbers or strings
(the prevalence of lists of strings in particular is a good reason for using CSV)







Physics data is intricately linked with the spatial nature of the Entity,
so even though it's organized into a component,
it really can't be handled like other components.
Each Entity must figure out how to handle it's physics attributes,
especially Entity types like Text, which actively modify those attributes.
