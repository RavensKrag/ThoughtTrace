change serialize flow

separate flow
	style
	physics
	queries
	
I mean, should all have the same form
but they should be done "separately"
(the query component is dependent on the style and physics ones, so that needs to be taken into account)



assuming current flow to serialize entities basically just saves physics data
but each component should be separated out into it's own serialization flow






Ideally, the instructions to save each component on the Entity could be inlined,
and that blob could be optimized
pruning out automatically what data does not need to be serialized
because it can be generated based on existing data
(or it just is plain never loaded for whatever reason)
