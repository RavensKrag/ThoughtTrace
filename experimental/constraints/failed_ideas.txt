failed ideas that may be useful in other ways



when to fire constraints?
	functional style - unique frame data

	"stateless" form that preserves the data
	from the previous frame, totally unchanged
		(((  want to link to unchanged data when possible though,
		     just to save on memory  )))
	potentially really useful down the road,
	because this format protects against screen tearing


flattening method chains?
	flatten out calls, so that it would be easier to define a 'dirty' trigger / callback
	ie)
		entity[:physics].body.p.x = 2
		could 'flatten' into one method call, instead of a method chain
		
		(this isn't going to work, as it will not interface with any library that has state)
