clone collection

when does Text get added?
on Edit action?
on buffer open?

consider separation between human interface and tech backend
consider what happens on automation of complex tasks








don't want the Entities used for templating to be editable
should not be able to reach into the collection and edit them
would be a weird way of passing around Entity objects in an unauthorized way

can't totally prevent this sort of thing (Ruby has instance_variable_get, after all)
maybe the Entities should be at least cloned upon insertion,
so that way the original Entity can be GCed or w/e without issues?

(would also mean that if the reference object changed,
the protoype in the clone factory would remain unchanged)

(not sure if that's good or bad)










clone factory

send clone factory to all actions
should generate new objects using clone factory
will generate clones of Text etc so that style properties are the same as last Text edited

Text edit action should update the reference clone
by putting a clone into the factory

(or maybe the copies should be made only when the new objects are requested?)
	(just don't allow read access to the objects being stored in the mean time)
	(don't want to be able to edit "random" entities through this collection)
