need to list ALL actions before trying to figure out which ones are mouse bound

some things are more ambiguous than they initially appear
ex) toggle query
not sure if it should be a keyboard command, so that you could convert many items into a query
(ie, based on selection)
or if it should be you just click one thing

note the implication if this logic is
if you have something that affects a whole group / selection,
it should be a keyboard command
