TODO: entity should warn when you request a 'component' with just an integer as an interface name



entity has array like interface, but should probably never be accepting an integer through that interface.
however, if there was supposed to be an array of entities being sent, and only one gets sent
then you'll get some weird errors

Entity should at least raise a warning when you attempt to access the Component access interface using an integer


(
	I think this was because this file
	
	/home/ravenskrag/Code/Tools/ThoughtTrace/lib/ThoughtTrace/constraint_system/enumerators/directed.rb
	
	has a variable called @entities
	and is expecting that to be a list of entity objects (ie, a integer-indexed array)
	but also has @entity    (note singular, vs plural)
	which is a reference to a single entity,
	which provides the [] method as a hash-style interface for accessing Components
)













( below is an old note, that describes this same bug )


bug: passed an entity where I meant to pass a list of entities


need to be careful about how you load the packed data back in
the pack is always a linear stream of data
(one flat array)
which creates problems when one of your arguments is inherently a list
