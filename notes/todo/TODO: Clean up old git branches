TODO: Clean up old git branches

old branches used to mark benchmark phases in development
are starting to clutter up the list of branches

convert some branches to tags?
just drop branches?

consider what happens to branches that are being held locally, but belong to old "remotes"
ie, some of the older projects (MARK_I, MARK_II, etc)
	(not those branches in particular, but the branches RELATED to them)
if my local copy of the repo is lost, some of those branches could be lost too
as they are not being backed up remotely anywhere
and I want to delete the old project folders soon
