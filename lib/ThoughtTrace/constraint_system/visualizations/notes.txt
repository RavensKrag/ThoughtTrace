visualizations have three states


unbound       # nothing set yet
bound         # Constraint is bound to targets, but waiting for the tick
active        # * I-just-activated-and-passed-some data


'active' will auto-transition back to 'bound' after a set period of time
'active' state is set by the system when the constraint is fired



Visualizations switch to 'active' as the Constraint is fired on the associated Pair,
and then revert to 'bound' after the Constraint is done executing.
Note that because all constraints must fire within one tick,
( systemic pressure to get full system updated for the next render frame )
it's not really necessary to actually measure how long they execute for.
( at least not for purposes of visualization. optimization is another story )
