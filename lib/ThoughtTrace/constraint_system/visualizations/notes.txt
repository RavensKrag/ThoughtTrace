visualizations have three states


unbound       # nothing set yet
bound         # Constraint is bound to targets, but waiting for the tick
active        # * I-just-activated-and-passed-some data


'active' will auto-transition back to 'bound' after a set period of time
'active' state is set by the system when the constraint is fired
