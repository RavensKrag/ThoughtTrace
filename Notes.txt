Need to figure out how to get two bits of text with different sizes to line up.
	It's not as simple as just lining up the beginnings of the two lines, because the spacing between the start of the line and the start of the string is different.  It may depend on the first character.
	
	But even if it does, the first characters of the two strings being identical doesn't fix the problem.


NOTE: There's a bit of a problem with Gosu::TextInput.  You can't type anything that requires SHIFT
	You can type capitals, but no special characters


TODO: Refactor the way that paint box is used by Text.  Too easy to forget to set the paint box and get all sorts of weird errors.
I would like to set the paint box in one place, but it seems like many errors could occur with the current framework.  

NOTE: Implement reformatting text (grabbing a section and creating a new object out of it) before reflowing blocks.  The reformatting feature will be helpful for prototyping auto-reflow.  Should probably have grouping as well.

text reflow --dependent on--> [reformatting, grouping]



Text size for new text objects should be the same as the previous object
	or for objects that were spawned out of other objects, the parent of the spawn


Input caret should stop flashing when the program loses focus
	This is common to all other applications, imo
	
	It's kinda annoying to lose your place because the caret went away though
	so there needs to be a solution to that




Click and drag in empty space should generate a text box
	more natural than typing something, and then spacing it into a box later
	you naturally create a box in your mind when you want to write something on a section of paper
	that's how you have an intuitive sense of where to stop writing and start a new line
	
	control of box guiding text flow and editing of text should be separate buttons, so that you can bounce between them with fluidity


ping feature for collaboration
	hold down button to charge
	cursor begins to gather light
	releasing quickly
		light leaves rapidly, emitting bell tone
		display ripples radiating from cursor
	hold + drag
		(draw path)
		cursor leaks glowing fluid
		glow fades over time

listify ability
	when a group of items is selected, offer option to listify
	
	take all items at approximately the same size
		average the size
		assign size to all
		create a style for easy group editing later (may want to disable?)
	all items at about the same size are assumed to be at the same level of the list
		(may want to do it by indentation instead / also)
	
	If there is no heading
		create heading
		select heading, ready for editing

mouse pick priority
	when selecting objects visually from hierarchy,
	hierarchy precedence should overtake visual structure
	
	when visually selecting objects that are grouped into a hierarchy,
	sort preference based on hierarchy, then visual structure
	
	when selecting objects visually from hierarchy,
	hierarchy should have priority over visual structure

advanced styles applied by regex patterns
	(could use other fancy method (lexer or w/e) to allow pattern matching)
	easily apply styles such as "select things in parentheses, make them small and washed out"
