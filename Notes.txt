Need to figure out how to get two bits of text with different sizes to line up.
	It's not as simple as just lining up the beginnings of the two lines, because the spacing between the start of the line and the start of the string is different.  It may depend on the first character.
	
	But even if it does, the first characters of the two strings being identical doesn't fix the problem.


I should probably not be dumb and just save all the objects in one file, instead of trying to save each object in it's own file

	Don't use Gosu::TextInput that will not allow for the editing of strings that have already been constructed.
		Nope, I was wrong.  Go ahead and use this.
		Just remember to set the current text with TextInput#text=

NOTE: There's a bit of a problem with Gosu::TextInput.  You can't type anything that requires SHIFT
	You can type capitals, but no special characters

* Multiple selection
* Some sort of grouping (fast movement of related elements without having to constantly reselect)
* Searching through text
* Copy + Paste inside program
* Copy + Paste using system clipboard
* Styles (all objects in a group take the same size etc. like an automated format painting tool)
