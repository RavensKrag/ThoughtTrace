Need to figure out how to get two bits of text with different sizes to line up.
	It's not as simple as just lining up the beginnings of the two lines, because the spacing between the start of the line and the start of the string is different.  It may depend on the first character.
	
	But even if it does, the first characters of the two strings being identical doesn't fix the problem.


NOTE: There's a bit of a problem with Gosu::TextInput.  You can't type anything that requires SHIFT
	You can type capitals, but no special characters
	

	    _   _________       __       _______________  ________  ______  ___________
	   / | / / ____/ |     / /      / ____/ ____/   |/_  __/ / / / __ \/ ____/ ___/
	  /  |/ / __/  | | /| / /      / /_  / __/ / /| | / / / / / / /_/ / __/  \__ \ 
	 / /|  / /___  | |/ |/ /      / __/ / /___/ ___ |/ / / /_/ / _, _/ /___ ___/ / 
	/_/ |_/_____/  |__/|__/      /_/   /_____/_/  |_/_/  \____/_/ |_/_____//____/  
* Multiple selection
* Some sort of grouping (fast movement of related elements without having to constantly reselect)
* Undo / Redo (may just implement later though version control?)
* Searching through text
* Copy + Paste inside program
* Copy + Paste using system clipboard
* Styles (all objects in a group take the same size etc. like an automated format painting tool)
	think of a pallet for styles
	a list of dynamic format swatches
		(dynamic because they update things they're already applied to)

* Kinetic scroll
	(common in touch apps which have drag panning)
	google maps actually has kinetic scroll in the desktop browser version as well
