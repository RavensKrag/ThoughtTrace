issues around the process of parameterizing constraints:


width             o     pushes out other params too far right if you want alignment
                                                      V---^----- spreadsheet problems
multi-liners      o     can only do single line commands
                        why are you sending an explicit lambda instead of a block?
                        you could use a lambda only when you need to send the block into two places

re-use            o     which objs can be used multiple times?
                        ...but to continue that train of thought,
                        is it possible to just reuse the entire object?

serialization     o     how do you serialize a parametrized constraint?
                        do you need to serialize a Proc?
	                        that seems a bit silly,
	                        because the Proc would have to be written somewhere



constraints can be reused once initialized
but their initializers are not always known ahead of time, like some of the other things
