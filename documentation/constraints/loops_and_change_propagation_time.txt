will the system systemically stop looping? or does it need a check?

(((  inspired by Massive Chalice's exploding alchemist armor,
     which chains, but does not loop  )))

wait no, it should systemically stop looping
like, it already does without having to do this

it will take a couple of iterations sometimes,
but the system should be able to realize that no values are changing,
and thus will "sleep" the constraints
and not update them
because they do not need to run
because values are not changing
and thus there are no values to propagate






I think the constraint system assumes that you only change one value in the graph per tick
then one entire tick can be dedicated to propagating that one change





but when you update, you want to use a dependency graph, not just a list
	update constraints based on dependency graph, or just a list?
