will the system systemically stop looping? or does it need a check?

(((  inspired by Massive Chalice's exploding alchemist armor,
     which chains, but does not loop  )))

wait no, it should systemically stop looping
like, it already does without having to do this

it will take a couple of iterations sometimes,
but the system should be able to realize that no values are changing,
and thus will "sleep" the constraints
and not update them
because they do not need to run
because values are not changing
and thus there are no values to propagate






I think the constraint system assumes that you only change one value in the graph per tick
then one entire tick can be dedicated to propagating that one change





but when you update, you want to use a dependency graph, not just a list
	update constraints based on dependency graph, or just a list?




how do you create that and traverse it?
the core graph is user-generated
but then the sub-graph is also a graph
and it may have some cycles in it
you need to prevent execution of a multiple looping paths through the graph in one tick


^ note that this means any sort of 'linear-ization' of the graph will have to check for cycles


but the standard technique being applied going forward,
does not need to check for cycles
because it will only evaluate each edge once per tick
