=====
+ Variable usage
=====
	 generally speaking...
	 
	------------------
	@initial     set once, created during #setup and never changed
	@future      altered in a process of iterative creation, created many times in #update

	other variables can be added as necessary within Memento itself,
	and allow for passing of state between the two halves of #forward and #reverse
	------------------
	
	---
		(note that this means that both @initial and @future can be lists of elements)
		(However, they don't necessarily have to be. Each Action can have it's own way of doing things)
	---


	values stored in instance variables of Action,    (@space, @selection, @text_input, @clone_factory)
	which are set on initialization,
	should always be passed to Memento though @initial,
	as they are values that will not change for the entire execution of the Action


	It's conceivable that these values could change,
	but the values will never be updated in Action,
	because the values are only ever passed on Action initialization

	Thus, the Action will retain a snapshot of the values used when the action was initiated.




=====
+ Memento execution flow, and purpose
=====
	Memento exists to provide *cancel*, rather than *undo*
	
	
	
	why does memento exist with forward/backward?
	to cancel button presses
	not necessarily to allow for undo structure

	can still build on current structure, but it's not there for explicitly that purpose

	edit action just opens the buffer, so it's #backward closes the buffer
	backward does not undo the edit,
	as that would imply undoing the changes made while the buffer is active

	would leave it to the text input system to control that part of the "undo"
	if and when an undo system is implemented

	(want to experiment with just using version control instead)














TODO: consider that writing new versions of Memento may be unnecessary if the Memento always passes the @future / @initial value(s) to #forward / #reverse. That's not currently what's happening necessarily, but that might be a good direction to go in.



NOTE: some mementos make use of variables stored in @initial as well as @future
which means that to fully separate the variables being sent to each phase
would be to understand and allow for control of that dynamic
