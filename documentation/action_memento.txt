generally speaking...

@initial is stuff set once, created during #setup and never changed
@future is stuff that is altered in a process of iterative creation, created many times in #update

other variables can be added as necessary within Memento itself,
and allow for passing of state between the two halves of #forward and #reverse





values stored in instance variables of Action,
which are set on initialization,
should always be passed to Memento though @initial,
as they are values that will not change for the entire execution of the Action



It's conceivable that these values could change,
but the values will never be updated in Action,
because the values are only ever passed on Action initialization

Thus, the Action will always retain a snapshot of the values used when the action was initiated.








TODO: consider that writing new versions of Memento may be unnecessary if the Memento always passes the @future / @initial value(s) to #forward / #reverse. That's not currently what's happening necessarily, but that might be a good direction to go in.
