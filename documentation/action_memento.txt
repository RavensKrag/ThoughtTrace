generally speaking...

@past is stuff set once, created during #setup and never changed
@future is stuff that is altered in a process of iterative creation, created many times in #update

other variables can be added as necessary within Memento itself,
and allow for passing of state between the two halves of #forward and #reverse








TODO: consider that writing new versions of Memento may be unnecessary if the Memento always passes the @future / @past value(s) to #forward / #reverse. That's not currently what's happening necessarily, but that might be a good direction to go in.
