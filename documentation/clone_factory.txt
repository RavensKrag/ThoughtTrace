Create new objects from clones of established prototypes,
rather than passing necessary arguments to the constructors for those objects.

This allows for zero-argument initialization,
which is necessary for easy creation of Entity objects through Actions



Cloning of Entities is achieved by taking advantage of the serialization system
pack/unpack structure from the serialization,
allows for "serialization"-like feel, without having to actually go all the way to the disk.
The entire operation can be performed in memory without additional special facilities.









read only templates
freeze the objects
(note that the default freeze implementation is not a deep freeze)
(deep like deep copy)
actually, deep copy might be dangerous
you don't want to freeze things like Font that will be used all over the place
	(basically, only freeze objects related by composition, not aggregation)
		(only objects which have lifetimes linked to the core frozen object)
