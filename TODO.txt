improve mouseover state
	+ On Mar 2nd: "Note flickering of mouseover state on drag"
	



using builder pattern, getting dependency list and interface name from the class is a bit obtuse
	consider moving at least the name into the instance level
	not like you're really spending that much extra memory anyway
	it's either just one symbol, or a pointer to some shared collection


BUG
	resizing text horizontally from center of right edge
	immediately after resizing from center of bottom edge
	results in text disappearing and program freezing
	
	not sure if this is a Gosu issue,
	an issue with limited system resources,
	or an issue with my code



May want to change how text resizes horizontally on center drag
	computes 'center' as the center of the vertical distance of the hitbox
	this is not the same as the 'center' of the text, which should be located at the midline




If Style is created without a parent, it's parent should default to the baseline style
	not sure where the baseline style should be declared,
	it should be a constant variable that can be easily accessed from everywhere
	it should declare all available properties




Make Camera only draw items from the space that it detects.
	Not sure if this should be a modification to the core camera,
	or if it should be some camera subclass.
	
	This is much better than the current structure of passing in things to render,
	and only using Camera for transform.
	
	This will allow for things like camera culling, which is nice.


Figure out how to change Entities when style properties are altered




edit space point query
should be able to get a list of things under the mouse
only highligh the one that the mouse will be working on
it seems weird that you would highlight something that you can't act on?
	that means that the selection has to change a little bit depending on what action is active
	is that too much state going into the selection?
	will that be the user's expected model of operation?
