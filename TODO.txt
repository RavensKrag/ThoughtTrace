TODO


using builder pattern, getting dependency list and interface name from the class is a bit obtuse
	consider moving at least the name into the instance level
	not like you're really spending that much extra memory anyway
	it's either just one symbol, or a pointer to some shared collection





If Style is created without a parent, it's parent should default to the baseline style
	not sure where the baseline style should be declared,
	it should be a constant variable that can be easily accessed from everywhere
	it should declare all available properties




Figure out how to change Entities when style properties are altered




edit space point query
should be able to get a list of things under the mouse
only highligh the one that the mouse will be working on
it seems weird that you would highlight something that you can't act on?
	that means that the selection has to change a little bit depending on what action is active
	is that too much state going into the selection?
	will that be the user's expected model of operation?
