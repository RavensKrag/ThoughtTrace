TODO



create components and actions using builder pattern
	user creates a action / component object
	pass that object into the system
	system assigns extra values to that object, which resolve dependencies etc.



If Style is created without a parent, it's parent should default to the baseline style
	not sure where the baseline style should be declared,
	it should be a constant variable that can be easily accessed from everywhere
	it should declare all available properties




edit space point query
should be able to get a list of things under the mouse
only highligh the one that the mouse will be working on
it seems weird that you would highlight something that you can't act on?
	that means that the selection has to change a little bit depending on what action is active
	is that too much state going into the selection?
	will that be the user's expected model of operation?
